                In team members, you can see information about our team members.
                In hour of code, you can learn about how we made "Hour of Code"
                In code artist, there is beautiful code-art of a tree.
                It was our first time trying to create website, even through we learned something in codecademy, it still was hard.
                We decided to use dark colors, but it seems it was not that good of idea.
