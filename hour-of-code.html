                <p id="vn">Our team, Team 51- consisting of Ravan Sadigzade, Fatima Baghirli, Elnur Nasibov, and Ibrahim Suleymanzada-was tasked with organizing an Hour of Code event. This event is designed 
                    to show young people that anyone can learn the basics of coding, regardless of their background or prior experience.
                     We decided to run this event in School №-132-134 at 7 November. We had 20 children about age of 10. Their teacher also was there to watch. First, we started by brief introduction of ADA. We did it with the slides that we were given. 
                     We tried to explain algorithms with examples that children would easily understand. For example, we compared algorithms to cooking recipes .Then, we opened code.org course "Classic Maze" on each computer. This is course where children, through basic coding with blocks, must lead different characters successfully 
                     through the maze. Children started solving problems. We would walk around and help anyone that needed help and explained these problems on the board, so that everyone can see and understand the solution. By the end of Hour of code, with our guidance, all children finished all 20 puzzles that were in the course. To further motivate the children and recognize their hard work, we decided to present each of them with an official certificate at the end of the event. Lastly, we would like to express our sincere thanks to School №-132-134 for hosting the event. It was an incredible opportunity to introduce these students to the world of coding, and we hope to continue inspiring future generations to 
                     explore the exciting field of computer science. You can learn more <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCMeQhHNWj7/?igsh=MWN5YnVieDhvOHV2NQ%3D%3D&img_index=1">here</a>
